## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a character from a younger generation discovers a physical object (a letter, a photo, a tool) that contradicts the family's official story about an ancestor.
- Imagine a conversation between Kai and a contemporary friend who sees his family's shophouse not as a treasure, but as a burden holding them back from modern success.
- Draft a monologue from the perspective of Wee Teck, explaining his shame and his strategy of silence to a confidant he will never have.
- Create a 'found document'—a ledger entry, a ration order, a faded letter—from Tan Hock Seng's time that reveals a moral dilemma he faced.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build an interactive 'archive' website for the novel, where users can click on items in a 3D model of the rosewood cabinet to reveal fragments of ledgers, letters, and historical context.
- Develop a text analysis tool that compares the language and syntax used in dialogue by the three generations (Kai, Li An, Wee Teck) to visualize their emotional and ideological distances.
